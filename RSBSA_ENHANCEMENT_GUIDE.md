## 🎯 **RSBSA Number Assignment Process**

### **RSBSA Number Management Workflow:**
1. **Municipal Staff Assignment** - Agricultural office staff manually assigns RSBSA numbers
2. **System Recording** - Staff enters RSBSA numbers into the system with tracking
3. **Validation Process** - Staff validates RSBSA number format and uniqueness
4. **Tracking & Audit** - System tracks who assigned numbers and when

### **RSBSA Number Format:**
```
Example formats:
- 10-43-24-001-000001 (with dashes)
- 1043240001000001 (without dashes)
- Custom formats as determined by municipal policy
```

**Note:** RSBSA numbers are manually assigned by municipal agricultural office staff and tracked in the system.

## 📊 **Comprehensive Validation Rules**

- Reasonable yield expectations
- Valid crop seasons
- Livestock numbers validation
- Economic data consistency

### **Enrollment Business Rules:**

- Farm profile must exist before enrollment
- Document requirements must be complete
- Production data must be realistic

## 🛠️ **API Endpoints**
